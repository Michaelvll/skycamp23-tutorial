    "# Using Managed Spot Instances with `sky spot launch`\n",
    "Any SkyPilot task can be launched on spot instances by simply using `sky spot launch task.yaml` instead of `sky launch task.yaml`. The `sky spot` CLI offers three key commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`sky spot launch <task.yaml>`** - Launches a managed spot job.\n",
    "2. **`sky spot status`** - Shows the status of managed spot jobs.\n",
    "3. **`sky spot logs <job_id>`** - Fetches the logs of a spot job.\n",
    "4. **`sky spot cancel <job_id>`** - Cancels a spot job.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the lifecycle of spot jobs, SkyPilot uses a controller that handles job launching and failure recovery. On running `sky spot launch`, SkyPilot first launches a controller (if it does not exist) and then runs the job."
