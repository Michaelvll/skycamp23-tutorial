# SkyPilot Tutorial üë©‚Äçüè´
Welcome to [SkyPilot](https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot) tutorial! This tutorial is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that will walk you through the basics of using SkyPilot.

# Installation
To setup the dependencies for this tutorial, run the following command:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the tutorial
It is recommended to run the tutorial with jupyter lab. In a terminal in the root of the repository, run:
```console
jupyter lab
```
Jupyter lab should now be running. You follow the URL generated by jupyter lab to open the tutorial in your browser.

If you do not have SkyPilot installed, refer to the [installation guide](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html). Otherwise, you can start with `01_hello_sky`.


## Running the tutorial in a Docker container
If you prefer to run the tutorial in a Docker container, you can do so by running the following command:
```console
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -it public.ecr.aws/a9w6z7w5/skypilot-tutorial:latest
```
Note that you may need to setup credentials inside the container.

If you would like to skip credential setup in the container and use your local credentials, copy your `~/.aws/` and `~/.config/` directories to a new directory `/tmp/credentials` such that it contains`/tmp/credentials/.aws/` and `/tmp/credentials/.config/gcloud/` directories with the relevant files. Then, run the following command:

```console
docker run --rm -v /tmp/credentials:/credentials:ro 8888:8888 -it public.ecr.aws/a9w6z7w5/skypilot-tutorial:latest
```

This will automatically install the AWS and GCP credentials inside the container.
